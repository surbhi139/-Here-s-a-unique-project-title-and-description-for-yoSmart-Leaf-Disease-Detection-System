Smart Leaf Disease Detection System
Overview
The Leaf Disease Detection System uses advanced machine learning techniques to classify plant leaves into four categories: healthy, scab, rust, and multiple diseases. This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant health issues early, enabling timely intervention and improved crop management.

Features
Ensemble Learning: Combines EfficientNet and DenseNet models for enhanced accuracy and robustness.
Real-Time Processing: Processes images in real-time for immediate disease identification.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, making it accessible for farmers and agricultural practitioners.
Dataset
The model is trained on the Plant Pathology 2020 dataset, which contains labeled images of plant leaves representing various diseases. The dataset is categorized into:

Healthy
Scab
Rust
Multiple Diseases
